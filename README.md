# unreact 
A library of boilerplate demonstrations implementing state management, custom events, single-page application routing, representational state transfer request and response management, et al, using plain standards-compliant JavaScript sans framework (aka "vanilla"). IOW, DIY.

This is not a framework or an anti-framework. It's just code that might prove useful.
